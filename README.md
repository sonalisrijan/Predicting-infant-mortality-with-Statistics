# Predicting-infant-mortality-with-Statistics
A binary prediction model to predict whether a set of features included in the natality survey data from 2018 [1] can predict whether a child will be born alive or not. 
The dataset for our problem has been collected by the Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC), and publicly available at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). It corresponds to public natality data in the United States excluding US territories in 2018.
